A comprehensive web interface for the RION Oracle Network — a BNB-native oracle system with provable data feeds, dispute resolution, and user insurance mechanisms.

## Overview

RION Oracle App is a full-featured frontend for interacting with the RION Oracle Network on BNB Chain. The application provides tools for:

- **Viewing and managing oracle data feeds** across multiple asset classes (crypto, sports outcomes)
- **Inspecting price history and feed integrity** with cryptographic proof verification
- **Participating in dispute resolution** through community voting
- **Managing prediction markets** and game outcome tracking
- **Accessing oracle SDK documentation** and integration guides
- **Receiving insurance compensation** for losses due to bad oracle data

The app serves developers, traders, and oracle operators who need to interact with on-chain price feeds, verify data integrity through BLS signatures and Merkle proofs, and participate in the network's governance mechanisms.

## Key Features

- **Provable Price Data** — BLS signatures and Merkle proofs for cryptographic verification of every price update
- **Live Feed Monitoring** — Real-time price feeds for crypto assets (BNB, ETH, BTC, SOL, XRP, DOGE, LINK) and sports outcomes
- **Public Dispute System** — Challenge incorrect oracle reports with community voting and resolution
- **User Insurance Vault** — Track and claim compensation for losses caused by bad oracle data
- **Receipt Verification** — Inspect and prove oracle data integrity with on-chain receipts
- **Prediction Markets** — View and interact with prediction market contracts and outcomes
- **SDK Integration** — Documentation and examples for developers building on RION
- **Explorer Dashboard** — Browse contracts, transactions, and network status
- **Wallet Integration** — Full Web3 support via RainbowKit and Wagmi for BNB Chain (Testnet & Mainnet)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ (check with `node --version`)
- **pnpm** 8+ or **npm** 9+ (this project uses pnpm-lock.yaml)
- **Git** for version control

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RionOracle/RionOracle.git
cd rion-app
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root (see [Configuration & Environment Variables](#configuration--environment-variables) section below):
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local  # if an example exists
# or manually create and populate .env.local
```

### Development

Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
# or
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:3000**

### Production Build

Build for production:
```bash
pnpm run build
# or
npm run build
```

Start the production server:
```bash
pnpm run start
# or
npm run start
```

## Configuration & Environment Variables

The application requires several environment variables for blockchain interaction and API integrations. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT commit `.env.local` or any `.env` files to version control. The repository's `.gitignore` already excludes these files.

### Network & RPC Configuration

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL` | BNB Chain RPC endpoint (testnet or mainnet) | `https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545` |

### Contract Addresses

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEED_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` | FeedRegistry contract address for price data feeds |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISPUTE_ADDRESS` | Dispute contract address for dispute resolution |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSURANCE_VAULT_ADDRESS` | InsuranceVault contract address for user compensation |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECEIPT_STORE_ADDRESS` | ReceiptStore contract address for proof verification |

### Aggregator Addresses (Price Feed Oracles)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BNB_AGGREGATOR_ADDRESS` | Aggregator for BNB/USD price feed |

## Core Modules

### Price Feeds (`app/explorer/`)
Real-time oracle price feeds with historical data, verification proofs, and feed status.

### Disputes (`app/disputes/`)
Interface for challenging oracle reports, voting on disputes, and viewing resolution outcomes.

### Insurance (`app/proof/`, `app/receipts/`)
View available insurance claims, verify proof of losses, and manage compensation claims.

### Predictions (`app/predictions/`)
Interact with prediction market contracts, view available markets, and track outcomes.

### Documentation (`app/docs/`, `app/api-docs/`)
Comprehensive guides for SDK integration, contract interaction, and API usage.

## Blockchain Networks

RION Oracle App supports both testnet and mainnet deployments:

| Network | Chain ID | RPC Endpoint | Block Explorer |
|---------|----------|--------------|---|
| BNB Testnet | 97 | https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545 | https://testnet.bscscan.com |
| BNB Mainnet | 56 | https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org | https://bscscan.com |

Switch networks via the wallet connection interface or by updating `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL`.

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

The project is optimized for [Vercel](https://vercel.com):

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy automatically on push to main

### Self-Hosted

Deploy to any Node.js hosting:

```bash
# Build production bundle
pnpm run build

# Set environment variables in your host
export NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=...
export NEXT_PUBLIC_FEED_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=...
# ... other env vars

# Start server (ensure Node.js 18+ is installed)
pnpm run start
```

### Docker

Create a `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment (example):

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Development & Contributing

### Code Quality

- **ESLint** enforces code style consistency
- **TypeScript** ensures type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** provides utility-first styling

Run linting:
```bash
pnpm run lint
```

### Adding New Pages

1. Create a new directory under `app/` (e.g., `app/my-feature/`)
2. Add `page.tsx` for the route
3. Import layout and components as needed
4. Follow existing patterns for wallet integration and contract interaction

### Adding New Feeds/Markets

1. Update contract addresses in `lib/contracts.ts`
2. Add environment variables in `.env.local`
3. Create new page or component to display the feed
4. Use existing fetch/query hooks from `lib/` or create new ones

## Security Considerations

- **Never commit `.env.local` or `.env.*` files** — they may contain sensitive keys
- **Private keys should only be in server-side code** — never pass to client components
- **Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` prefix ONLY for client-safe variables** — values are visible to users
- **Verify all contract addresses before interacting** — especially on mainnet
- **Keep dependencies updated** — run `pnpm update` periodically

## Troubleshooting

### Port 3000 already in use

Run on a different port:
```bash
pnpm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### Module not found errors

Clear cache and reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules
pnpm install
```

### Wallet connection issues

- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL` is valid
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure wallet (MetaMask, etc.) is connected to the correct network
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Contract address errors

- Verify contract addresses in `.env.local`
- Check that addresses are valid for the connected network
- Ensure contracts are deployed on the target network
